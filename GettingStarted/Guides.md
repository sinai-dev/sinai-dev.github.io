# Guides & Examples

This page contains some guides and examples to help you get started using SideLoader.

## My First SL Mod
First, have a quick read of the [SL Packs](GettingStarted/SLPacks) article to understand how to work with SideLoader from folders. No knowledge of C# is necessary for this.

Next, use the [SL Menu](GettingStarted/SLMenu) to generate a template from an existing asset, then have a look at the files SideLoader created.

Have a look at the related article (eg. [Custom Items](Custom/Items), [Custom Status Effects](Custom/StatusEffects), etc) to get a better understanding of what you're looking at. There might be a lot of information, don't worry if you don't understand it all right away.

Take the generated files and put them in your first SL Pack (eg. `Outward\Mods\SideLoader\Test\`), and make sure to use the correct sub-folder structure for your asset (eg `\Test\Items\MyItem\MyItem.xml`, `\Test\StatusEffects\MyStatus\MyStatus.xml`, etc).

Now start editing the XML or the PNG files however you like. If you're not used to editing XML, there are various tools you can use online to help with editing and verifying it.

Start the game and spawn or debug in your asset, and have a look at the changes.

If there were any errors, SideLoader should log them in the file `Outward\output_log.txt`.
