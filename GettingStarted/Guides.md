# Guides & Examples

This page contains some guides and examples to help you get started using SideLoader.

## Making a Custom Item
?> This guide introduces you to the concept of SL Packs, and shows you how to edit an Item.

Before we start, have a quick read of the [SL Packs](GettingStarted/SLPacks) article to understand how to work with SideLoader from folders. No knowledge of C# is necessary for this.

Next, start Outward. We are going to use the [SL Menu](GettingStarted/SLMenu) to generate a template from an existing Item for us.

1. In game, press <b>Ctrl + Alt + F6</b> to open the SL Menu. 
2. In the Items panel, enter `2000010` as the Target Item ID, as well as the New Item ID. 
3. Press the button to generate the template.

Let's find the template SideLoader generated.

1. Open `Outward\Mods\SideLoader\_GENERATED\`, this is where SideLoader generates templates to. 
2. Inside here, you should see an `Items\` sub-folder
3. Inside Items, you should see a folder called `2000010_IronSword\`.

![The `_GENERATED\` folder should look like this.](https://i.imgur.com/tqcQTzc.png)

Now we need to move this folder into our own SL Pack.

1. <b>Cut</b> this Iron Sword folder (Ctrl+X)
2. Go back to the `SideLoader\` folder. Create a new folder in here called `Test\`. 
3. Create a sub-folder in Test called Items (`Test\Items\`)
4. <b>Paste</b> (Ctrl+V) the Iron Sword folder in here. 

It should now look like this: `Outward\Mods\SideLoader\Test\Items\2000010_IronSword\`.

Now let's make a basic change to the Item.

1. Open the `2000010_IronSword\Iron Sword.xml` file and have a look. 
2. Have a look at the <b>Description</b> field. Since there is no value set, it is displayed as `<Description />` in the XML file.

![The SL_Item XML file should look something like this.](https://i.imgur.com/zfrmzTJ.png)

To set a value, we will need to expand the brackets. 
1. Delete the existing value for the Description completely.
2. Replace the value with this: `<Description>Test.</Description>`.

Before we start the game and inspect our changes, make sure you have enabled the <b>Outward Debug Menu</b> first:
1. Open the folder `Outward\Outward_Data\`
2. Create a .txt file called "DEBUG", it should look like `DEBUG.txt`. <b>Note:</b> if you have "Show File Extensions" disabled, it will need to look like "DEBUG" instead of "DEBUG.txt".

With Debug Mode enabled, start Outward. Once in-game, press <b>F1</b> to open the Item Spawner, then spawn an Iron Sword and have a look, our description should now be set.

If there were any errors, SideLoader should log them in the file `Outward\output_log.txt`.

## Replacing Basic Assets

?> This guide shows you an example of how you can replace simple assets (Audio / Music).

First, let's replace some music. Pick any song you want to use and make sure it is a `.wav` file (there are many free online converters for this if you need one).

Create a Test SL Pack (`Outward\Mods\SideLoader\Test\`), and create a `AudioClip\` sub-folder inside it. Put your `.wav` file inside the `AudioClip\` sub-folder (for example, `Test\AudioClip\MySong.wav`).

Next, rename your audio clip so that it matches the name of an existing audio clip. For this example, we will use the title screen music. Rename your audio clip to `BGM_GeneralTitleScreen.wav`.

Start the game, and you should now hear your audio clip.

For textures (not including certain menu assets), you can replace them in the same fashion with `.png` files. Put the texture `.png` file in the `Texture2D\` sub-folder of your pack. To get the name of a texture for replacement, see [this article](Replacing/Textures?id=finding-textures).
