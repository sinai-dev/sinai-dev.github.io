# Effects

An <b>SL_Effect</b> object can be defined on an [Effect Transform](Effects/EffectTransforms). 

## How to define one

When defining an SL_Effect, simply define them like any other Xml object inside the `Effects` list of the EffectTransform.

```xml
<!-- replace 'EffectType' with the actual effect type -->
<SL_Effect xsi:type="EffectType">
    <!-- put fields and values for this effect here -->
</SL_Effect>
```

For example:

```xml
<SL_Effect xsi:type="SL_AddStatusEffectBuildUp">
    <StatusEffect>Doom</StatusEffect>
    <Buildup>60</Buildup>
</SL_Effect>
```

* Used to override the weapon's damage to a certain element
* You can set this to `COUNT` to bypass any override.
* Otherwise, must be one of: `Physical`, `Ethereal`, `Decay`, `Electric` (<b>not</b> Lightning), `Frost`, or `Fire`.

`ForceOnlyLeftHand` (true/false)
* If true, it will ignore the damage on any required main-hand weapons, if there are any.

`Damage_Multiplier` (float)
* Multiplies the weapon damage by this number

`Damage_Multiplier_Kback` (float)
* If you want special multipliers when the target is knocked back, set this.
* Set to -1 to use Damage_Multiplier

`Damage_Multiplier_Kdown` (float)
* Same as Damage_Multiplier_KBack, but for knockdowns instead.

You also have `Impact_Multiplier`, `Impact_Multiplier_Kback` and `Impact_Multiplier_Kdown` which are the same but they're for impact damage.
